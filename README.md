# Project-0

# Description

This project is for exploring how to use HTML/CSS. It will mainly focus on learning how to style a web page 
as well as making it functional through the use of the search bar and search button. 

I am using Google Image and Search as well as the advanced search option for exprimenting with linking forms.

I would also like to incorporate flexbox features eventually. 


# Resources

I am using the Harvard CS50 edX course to learn most of these functions.
